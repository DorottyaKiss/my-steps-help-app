# My Steps Help | A website dedicated to a mobile application which can turn your steps into charity donations.

This project is a website which introduces the My Steps Help application. This application (further referred to as “the app”) converts the steps of users into charity donations. They can either do this by signing up with opening a private account or signing into a a team account to which their employer assigns them. 

The website is comprised of 4 pages: the Home page (including the Features of the App, the list of Charities), the Employers page (which includes a contact form), the Get The App page and the Thank You page. 

The website contains relevant information about the application, such as its features, user testimonials, a list of charities users can contribute to, an employer section for signing up as corporate teams, employer testimonials, a list of companies which work with the application, as well as a Get The App section which directs the visitors of the website to the app.

## Introduction

This website is created to give information about the fictitious My Steps Help mobile application, which is essentially 
a walking and running app converting steps into charity donations. Users can sign up either as individuals or through their
employers via a corporate account. They can then either choose to contribute to a charity which is featured in the app, or
work towards the charity goal their employer has chosen in teams. 

The aim of the website is to introduce the application, describe its value proposition to both end users (B2C use case) and 
employers (B2B use case) in a structured manner. The application intends to contribute to the physical and mental wellbeing
of people in a time when this is at the forefront of both private individuals and employers. During the COVID-19 era, companies are looking for a cost-effective, engaging and easy way to motivate their employees in a socially distanced manner. The app provides a solution to keeping people motivated while contributing to a charitable cause. 

As you can use this app through a personal or a team account, we found it important to provide testimonials to both use cases.
The list of charities and the list of employers presented on the website will give additional credibility of using the product.
Employers can get in contact with My Steps Help Ltd. through a form, where they will be able to obtain a personalized quote for opening a corporate account. 

A future improvement/addition to the website could include a FAQ section and a contact chat where visitors of the site can get
in touch with the My Steps Help app team. We hope that this addition would further increase trust in the My Steps Help application.

### Design

#### Typography

* **Font Families**: Google Fonts Lato -for headings- and Roboto -for paragraphs- were used. 
Roboto, because it is easy to read and has a friendly, _humanist_ property - according to [Roboto’s designer](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text_type=custom#about). 
Lato has _warm and stable_ character according to [its designer] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text_type=custom#about) which goes well with the serious yet humanist character of the app. 

#### Colour Scheme

* **Font and Background Colours**: Colours were inspired by a deep learning algorithm [colormind.o](http://colormind.io/).
You can access the colour palette created by [coolors.co] at: (https://coolors.co/fafafa-d0e2e6-20b7be-27d6b3-ea4c68-333b50). 
Inspired by sources such as [99Designs] (https://99designs.ie/blog/creative-inspiration/psychology-color-web-design/), the choice of greens, such as #20B7BE, #27D6B3 symbolize the humanist and societal, environmental nature of the application, red is balancing it with liveliness and energy - drawing attention to the buttons, it is an ideal choice for sports, having a sense of urgency in it. 
#FAFAFA, #D0E2E6 and #333B50 give a stable and trustworthy balance to the above-mentioned brand colours. 

**Website Layout**: intuitive, consistent and efficient. Header and footer contain the menu. Circular images, logos provide consistency, clickable elements are recognizable upon mouse hover.
The hamburger menu icon replaces the standard navigation bar on tablet and mobile devices. This avoids crowding on smaller screen sizes. 
   
#### Imagery
* **Images Chosen**: A prominent background hero image helps users get inspired by the application and understand that it’s a sports and running theme. The images of users, employers give an approachable nature to the product and help with trust in the company. 

### Wireframes

At the start of the development phase, 12 wireframes (desktop, mobile, iPad tablet) were created for the website. 
[Balsamiq] (https://balsamiq.com/) was used for creating the wireframes.  The reason the mockups were created at the beginning of the process is to have an overview on the full extent of the website, the design and the project management aspect of the website would be conceptualized. This helped the creator make coding decisions about the required parts of the website. 
Some minor changes were done to the initial mockups including: 
Form layout on desktop: each team size option comes on a new line for airing the content a bit more. 
Header menu links - they have been put on the left side to balance the layout a bit more. 
The logo and the name of the app on the hamburger menu navigation bar - this was put in the middle to give a more prominent brand presence to the product. 
Wireframes accessible in the [Wireframes directory] (): 
[Desktop wireframes] ()
[Mobile wireframes] ()
[iPad tablet wireframes] ()

	* **Get In Touch section** - Transitions from a single-column layout on desktop to a double-column layout on mobile devices.


### Bugs

Bugs encountered and resolution:
  * **The app mockup image in the How It Works section was placed to the bottom of the column on large desktop devices** - Contacted tutor support of the Code Institute who suggested using a media query on top of the Bootstrap grid system, and suggested to take out “only” from the CSS code, as this is likely causing the anomalous behaviour even upon implementing a media query. Removing the “only” should only affect older browsers but it seemed that it affecting all browsers in this case.
  * ** Form <legend> error enveloped “Team Size”**- Third party code related issue discovered by the HTML validator. Changed <legend> to <label>.
